== requirements ==

- python3
- py-serial
- original Atmel FLIP (contains definitions for devices/protocols)

== install ==

Instalation is not needed, but device and protocol definitions are required
from original FLIP utility (I'm not allowed to bundle them with this program).

- Install/extract latest version of flip
- find directories "PartDescriptionFiles" and "ProtocolDescriptionFiles"
- copy them into project root

FIXME: instalation is not supported yet, add Python packaging support!

== usage ==

# list all supported devices, look at Atmel site if you favorite one missing.
python3 batch_isp -device ?

# read content of flash
python3 batch_isp -port /dev/ttyACM0 -device ATxmega128A1 -operations MEMORY FLASH READ SAVEBUFFER dump.hex 386HEX

# program device
python3 batch_isp -port /dev/ttyACM0 -device ATxmega128A1 -operations TODO

== Troubleshot ==

=== Comunucation trought /dev/ttyACM0 seems not working. ==
This issue is well known for Atmel Xmega Xplained ATxmeta128A1
board revision 7 (and may be others). Problem is caused by firmware
in gateway chip xxxUC3B1250. You need reprogram it with new FW.

 - need reflash firmware in proxy SOC
 - Install Atmel Studio 6 (rev 2) (Windows required)
 - create example project "USB driver ... ???"
 - build
 - enter proxy bootloader
 - connect kit trought USB to PC
 - upload hex with BatchISP for windows (or dfu-programmer?)

FIXME: detailed description of solution
