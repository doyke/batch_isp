== Requirements ==

- python 3
- py-serial
- original Atmel FLIP (contains definitions for devices/protocols)
  http://www.atmel.com/tools/flip.aspx

== Install ==

Instalation is not needed. For proper function program require original
device and protocol definitions from Atmel FLIP utility. These cannot be
bundled with this program because of copyright.

- install/extract latest version of FLIP (Wine might help)
- find directories "PartDescriptionFiles" and "ProtocolDescriptionFiles"
  usually can be found somewhere near C:\Program\ Files/ATMEL/Flip\ x.y.z/bin/
- copy them into root directory of this project

FIXME: instalation is not supported yet, add Python packaging support!

== usage ==

# list all supported devices, look at Atmel site if you favorite one missing.
python3 __main__.py -device ?

# read content of flash
python3 __main__.py -port /dev/ttyACM0 -device ATxmega128A1 -operations MEMORY FLASH READ SAVEBUFFER dump.hex 386HEX

# program device # TODO: add verify
python3 __main__.py -port /dev/ttyACM0 -device ATxmega128A1 -operations ERASE F BLANKCHECK MEMORY FLASH LOADBUFFER dump_flash.hex PROGRAM

== Troubleshot ==

=== Comunication trought /dev/ttyACM0 does not work (programmer timeouts). ==

Problem is described here.

This issue is well known for Atmel Xmega Xplained ATxmeta128A1
board revision 7 (and may be others). Problem is caused by firmware
in gateway chip ATUC3B1250. You need reprogram it with new FW.

 - install Atmel Studio 6 (Windows required)
 - create example project "USB driver ... ???"
 - build
 - enter board controller bootloader (short bcbootloader pins)
 - connect kit trought USB to PC
 - upload hex
  a) with original BatchISP
  b) with dfu-programmer
     http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/
 - unshort bcbootloader pins, restart ...

FIXME: detailed description of solution
